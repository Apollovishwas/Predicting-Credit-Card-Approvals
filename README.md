# Automated Credit Card Approval Predictor

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that automates the credit card approval process. By analyzing various applicant attributes, the model predicts whether a credit card application should be approved or rejected, mimicking the decision-making process of real banks.

## Dataset

The dataset is a subset of the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about credit card applications, with the following key features:

- Applicant demographics
- Financial information
- Credit history
- Employment details

The target variable is the approval decision (approved or rejected).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Scale numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze feature distributions
   - Identify correlations between features and approval decision
   - Visualize key insights

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features if necessary
   - Select most relevant features for prediction

4. **Model Development**:
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Train multiple classification models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Implement cross-validation for robust performance estimation

6. **Interpretation**:
   - Analyze feature importance
   - Understand model decisions

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation
